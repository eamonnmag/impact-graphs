  "body": "### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new `gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nImpactGraph.draw_impact_summary('data/author.json', \"#impact_graph_chart\", {\r\n        width: 600,\r\n        height: 300,\r\n        show_axes: true,\r\n        node_scaling: 0.012,\r\n        y_scale: 'log',\r\n        'content-type': 'application/x-impact.graph+json'\r\n    });\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by @eamonnmag with contributions from @jmartinm.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n\r\n",
